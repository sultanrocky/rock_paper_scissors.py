The rules are as follows:

Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.

Prompt the player to select number between 1 and 3 with input() and store it in player:

1 is for '✊' (Rock).
2 is for '✋' (Paper).
3 is for '✌️' (Scissors).
Then, use the random.randint() method to assign a number to the computer variable (1 to 3).

Lastly, use control flow to compare the user's choice and the computer's choice, determine the winner, and print out who won.

The output should look something like this:

===================
Rock Paper Scissors
===================

1) ✊
2) ✋
3) ✌️
Pick a number: 2

You chose: ✋
CPU chose: ✊
The player won!
